      <p>This project was built in partial fulfilment of the requirements to obtain Bachelor of Science by the Author (Miss Chigbue Queen), as part of her contributions towards reducing/eradicating exam malpractice especially in higher institutions.<br>
    the project was built and designed with Vanilla Javascript, HTML5, CSS3 and some libraries from open-source contributors.
    There are plans to expand the scope of the project as soon as posible.
